Strategic Mapping & Analysis Tool for Haiti
Project Overview
This project is the foundational work for a strategic mapping and multi-thematic analysis tool designed for humanitarian and development actors operating in Haiti. The primary objective is to create a robust data pipeline that integrates diverse datasets to provide a granular and up-to-date understanding of the food security landscape, cross-referenced with other critical variables like conflict, infrastructure, and humanitarian presence.

This repository currently houses a Jupyter Notebook that performs the crucial Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process, preparing disparate data sources for complex geospatial analysis. Although the project is a work in progress, this notebook represents the core engine of the intended final tool and demonstrates a scalable methodology for data harmonization.

Target Audience: NGOs, UN Agencies, Foundations, and Researchers.
Keywords: Haiti, Food Security, Data for Good, Geospatial Analysis, ETL, Strategic Planning.

üéØ Goal
The ultimate aim is to develop a decision-support tool that allows users to:

Visualize complex interactions between different thematic areas (e.g., how conflict events impact market prices).

Identify geographic areas with overlapping vulnerabilities.

Monitor key indicators over time to inform programmatic and strategic planning.

Generate data-driven insights for reports, proposals, and operational coordination.

‚ú® Core Features (Current State)
The current notebook (Haiti.ipynb) fully automates the data preparation phase through a modular and reusable pipeline.

1. Automated Data Ingestion
Dynamic Loader: Automatically scans a specified directory and loads all relevant datasets, including .csv, ESRI Shapefiles (.shp), and entire Geodatabases (.gdb).

Multi-Source Capability: Handles data from diverse sources like the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX), ACLED, and the World Food Programme.

2. Intelligent Data Cleaning & Transformation
ETL Functions: A suite of functions inspects, cleans, and standardizes both tabular and geospatial data.

Metadata Removal: Automatically strips extraneous header/footer rows common in humanitarian datasets.

Type Conversion: Intelligently converts columns to appropriate numeric and date formats for analysis.

3. Geospatial Harmonization
Canonical Geo-Table: Creates a unified, multi-level administrative boundary table (from ADM0 to ADM3) to serve as a single geographic reference. This solves common issues of inconsistent administrative boundaries across different datasets.

Automated Geo-referencing: Joins tabular data (e.g., conflict events, survey results) to the canonical geographic table using administrative "P-codes," making non-spatial data instantly mappable.

üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
The process is structured around a clear ETL workflow:

Extract: Datasets are loaded from their original formats into Pandas or GeoPandas DataFrames. The system is designed to be data-agnostic, easily incorporating new sources.

Transform:

Inspection: Each dataset is profiled to identify its structure, data types, and missing values.

Cleaning: Data is tidied for analysis (e.g., converting strings to numbers).

Standardization: All geographic data is re-projected to a common Coordinate Reference System (CRS) and linked via a master table of administrative boundaries.

Load: The processed and harmonized datasets are stored in a structured dictionary, ready for the next phase of analysis and visualization.

üìä Datasets Integrated
The pipeline has been successfully tested with the following data types:

Food Security: Food prices, household hunger indexes.

Conflict & Security: ACLED conflict event data.

Humanitarian Operations: 3W data (Who, What, Where).

Socio-Economic: Relative Wealth Index.

Infrastructure: Road networks (OpenStreetMap).

Geospatial: Official administrative boundaries of Haiti.

üöÄ Next Steps & Future Vision
This foundational ETL process is the first step. The project roadmap includes:

Analysis Module: Developing a library of functions for advanced spatial analysis (e.g., hotspot analysis, accessibility modeling, correlation analysis).

Interactive Dashboard: Building a web-based dashboard (using tools like Dash or Streamlit) to allow non-technical users to explore the data, create custom maps, and generate reports.

Predictive Modeling: Incorporating time-series analysis and machine learning models to forecast trends in food security or identify areas at future risk.

API Integration: Creating an API to serve the processed data to other applications or platforms.

üîß How to Use
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone [URL-del-tuo-repository]
Install dependencies:

Bash

pip install pandas geopandas fiona contextily seaborn matplotlib thefuzz sentence-transformers
Setup your environment:

Mount your Google Drive or specify the local path to your data folder within the notebook.

Ensure your datasets are placed in the designated folder.

Run the notebook Haiti.ipynb:

Execute the cells sequentially to perform the full ETL process. The processed data will be available in the final dictionary object for further exploration.
